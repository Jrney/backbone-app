### Known Issues, Bugs, and Tasks:
* Hook ups between RouteBoxer and Google Places Search are not finalized
* Proper routing to Pitstop page
    - Once established then work on integrating full features of Isotope sorting and filtering into Pitstops
* Several 'fake' buttons on main page need to be wired up or deleted
* More exhaustive testing needed
* 'Next Leg' button for more requests from google places
